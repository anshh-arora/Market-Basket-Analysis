# Market Basket Analysis Project

## Overview
Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to understand the purchase behavior of customers. It involves analyzing large sets of transaction data to identify patterns and relationships between items purchased together. The insights gained from Market Basket Analysis can be used for various purposes such as cross-selling, product placement optimization, and targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Description
In this project, I conducted Market Basket Analysis on transaction data from a retail store. The dataset contains the following columns:

- BillNo: The unique identifier for each transaction.
- Item name: The name of the item purchased.
- Quantity: The quantity of each item purchased in the transaction.
- Date: The date of the transaction.
- Price: The price of each item.
- CustomerID: The unique identifier for each customer.
- Country: The country where the transaction occurred.
- Month Name: The name of the month.
- Year: The year of the transaction.
- Day Name: The name of the day.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted exploratory analysis to gain insights into the distribution of variables, trends over time, and patterns in customer behavior.
3. **Market Basket Analysis**: Used association rule mining techniques such as Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
4. **Interpretation of Results**: Interpreted the generated association rules to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations for the retail store.

## Technologies Used
